            <p class="font-bold text-4xl p-6">“What is the difference between a home inspection and an appraisal?"</p>

            <p class="text-2xl p-4 max-w-6xl mx-auto">Usually the confusion starts with the the fact they both are needed prior to closing. The difference between these two is the simple fact that one determines the value of a home for your mortgage lender while the other determines the condition of a home for your benefit.

            <br>
            An appraisal is conducted by a licensed appraiser, meaning not just anyone can perform such duties, and although the job functions between these two are similar in timing, home inspectors provide the buyer with knowledge to make an informed decision before closing.  The inspection report will provide conditions of the home- real problems and solutions without opinion or bias.
